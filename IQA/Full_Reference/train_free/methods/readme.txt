For each new method you need to create a folder with the same name of the method's m-function.
For example if the method in paper Xue. et al-2014, is called with the following form in 
MATLAB statements:
>> quality_score = GMSD(ref, dst);
Then m-function will be named:
GMSD.m
Similarly, the folder will be named:
GMSD (i.e. the address of the m-function will be sth like: 
IQA_Lab/IQA/Full_Reference/train_free/methods/GMSD/GMSD.m)

The mentioned folder will contain the results of executing the method on various datasets.
