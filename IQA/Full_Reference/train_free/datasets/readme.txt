create a folder for each new dataset.
The folder must be named with the string that you will address the dataset in the tests.
Apart from this, you're free to do anything within that folder.
The thing is, the images of the datasets are not included in the repository, so you should place them in the right folder according to the readme in each folder.
(only screen content image datasets are accompanied with readme at the moment, but you should get an idea by taking a look at the codes for test.)
